-- Look at the size of what we want to create, and use either small or both.

-- This is useful for generators for recursive datatypes: one can pass generators
-- for the leaf nodes as the first argument, and branches for the second argument.
-- The second arguments will be called with a smaller size, so if this is used
-- recursively, the size will continue to reduce until only leaves are available.
--
-- For example, a tree might use:
--
-- > gen_tree = oneofSized
-- >  [ Leaf1 <$> arbitrary, Leaf2 <$> arbitrary ]
-- >  [ Branch <$> gen_tree ]
--
-- Because (Branch <$> gen_tree) will only be called when the size is greater than 1,
-- and gen_tree will be called with a smaller size, this makes an infinite chain
-- of branches impossible.
